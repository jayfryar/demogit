my cygwin 86 did not have git.

I could not get setup to run from another server and it died saying something about not finding setup.ini.


$ uname -a
CYGWIN_NT-6.1 Owner-PC 2.2.1(0.289/5/3) 2015-08-20 11:42 x86_64 Cygwin

I had git but I do not have my python there so I decided to install git on laptop.



"C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe" --cd-to-home
